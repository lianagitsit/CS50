What’s stdint.h?
// A library of integer types that defines integer sizes (widths?) in bits

What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
// These are exact-width integer types, which make the integers' width the same number of bits "across all implementations"

How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
// 1, 4, 4, 2

What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
// 424d

What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
// bfSize is the size of the bmp file, and biSize is the number of bytes the structure needs.

What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
// If biHeight is negative, the bitmap's origin is in the upper-left-hand corner, indicating a top-down configuration.

What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
// biBitCount

Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
// The file doesn't exist

Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
// Because we only need to read in from the file header and info header one time

What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
// 1 * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE) = 3 bytes

What does fseek do?
// Changes the location of the pointer position

What is SEEK_CUR?
// A constant that indicates that the pointer's offset is relative to its current position
